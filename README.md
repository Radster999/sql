SQL Data Querying

I am using PostgreSQL 17 on pgAdmin 9.5 to access a database from the file, dvdrental.tar, downloaded locally to my laptop. I am simulating a data analyst working on analysis for a DVD rental store by completing challenges proposed in my SQL Bootcamp by PIERIAN DATA on Udemy.

In this project, I will be practising inserting and querying data in business situations using SQL.

Below will be all the queries and visuals of their outcome, and I will link the raw code on the ["SQL-code"]([url](https://github.com/Radster999/sql/blob/main/SQL-code)) page.


1. We want to send out a promotional email to our existing customers. Pull the first and last names of every customer and their email address.

2. We have a visitor who isn't from the USA. They're from Australia, and so they're not familiar with the Motion Picture Association of America's movie rating system, such as PG, PG-13, R, etc..
So we need to know what types of ratings we have in our database.
What ratings do we have available?
